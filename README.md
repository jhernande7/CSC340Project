Description
Car Service Finder is an intuitive and user-friendly web application designed to help users easily locate affordable car services, such as car washes, oil changes, and tire replacements, based on their location preferences.

Using the Google Maps API for location-based search, our users will have the ability to find nearby service providers, view detailed pricing information, and read customer reviews to help them make informed decisions.

Customers will be able to create and manage their profiles, view available services, subscribe to the services they are interested in, and leave reviews for services theyâ€™ve used.

Service Providers will be able to create, modify, and remove their service profiles, list available services, view customer statistics (e.g., views, subscriptions), and reply to customer reviews to maintain engagement.

SysAdmins will manage user access, moderate services and reviews, and view overall system usage statistics to ensure the quality of the platform.

The application will persistently save data using a RESTful API written in Java and store it in a MySQL database, ensuring that users can access their data across different sessions and devices. This platform will provide a streamlined, comprehensive solution for both customers and service providers, making it easier to find and manage car services locally.
